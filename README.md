# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation behind **The Prework Study Guide Web Application**, was to create a website that could store and organize key information students would need to study from the *Prework Modules*. The information outlined in the modules creates a foundation for future lessons in the ***Coding Boot Camp***, to build upon. This web application replaces handwritten notes which can be unorganized and cannot be accessed as easily as when they are stored digitally. By following the Github workflow, and using the command line, I created this website with my newfound knowledge of Git, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. These skills are demonstrated in the existence of **The Prework Study Guide Web Application** and are proven in its functionality. I, and future students will benefit from this web application as they navigate the *Prework Modules*.
