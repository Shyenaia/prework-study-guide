        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML: Hypertext Markup Language - is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML is made of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>Common elements: text elements, image elements, header elements, list elements.</li>
          <li>Some elements are used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
          <li>Some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page: Meta-related elements, content division elements, semantic elements.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with (< >). These elements can include other nested elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. Elements in the "head" are not visible to users.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>"<!DOCTYPE>" is not case sensitive because it is a declaration, declarations are not case sensitive. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The "title" element defines the title for a webpage, it is required and is EXTREMELY important for SEO(search engine optimization)</li>
          <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The "base" element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The "link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The "meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The "script" element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called "child elements".</li>
          <li>The elements inside of a "body" element are known as child elements. The "body" element would be known as the "parent element". The "body" element is an example of a semantic HTML.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When possible it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. It also plays an important role in making sure a webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
          <li>The words "elements" and "tag" are commonly used interchangeably. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>"ul", "ol", and "li" represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
        </ul>
