        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML: Hypertext Markup Language - is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML is made of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>Common elements: text elements, image elements, header elements, list elements.</li>
          <li>Some elements are used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
          <li>Some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page: Meta-related elements, content division elements, semantic elements.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with (< >). These elements can include other nested elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. Elements in the "head" are not visible to users.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>"<!DOCTYPE>" is not case sensitive because it is a declaration, declarations are not case sensitive. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The "title" element defines the title for a webpage, it is required and is EXTREMELY important for SEO(search engine optimization)</li>
          <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The "base" element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The "link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The "meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The "script" element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called "child elements".</li>
          <li>The elements inside of a "body" element are known as child elements. The "body" element would be known as the "parent element". The "body" element is an example of a semantic HTML.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When possible it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. It also plays an important role in making sure a webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
          <li>The words "elements" and "tag" are commonly used interchangeably. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>"ul", "ol", and "li" represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets -  is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. We use CSS to define syle rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>To style directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Inline style CSS is useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>It is possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a "style" element in the "head" element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns: is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is one of the key design principles that we practice in the boot camp. Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration "color: blue;" includes the CSS property "color" and the value for that property, "blue".</li>
          <li>The margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase the padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger.</li>
          <li>The HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box mode.</li>
          <li>DRY code: Do Not Repeat Yourself - is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written and maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
